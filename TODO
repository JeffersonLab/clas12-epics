# TODO List
#

# /usr/clas12/DATA/logs:
  * check rotation - autodelte old empty files?
  * caput server working?

# FT Moxa:
  * take back to hall for Helmholtz PS
  * put 'FLAKY' back, now that switch replaced

# SVT:
  * hostname=iocclasscsvt, iocname=iocvmesvt -- unify
  * restructure access to hv/lv channels so don't need to know what crate
  * initialize chiller pump level ao properly
  * clonify svtl01
  * confirm with Yuri removal of dbpfing of alarm settings from startups (autosave should already take care of it)

# tsconnect:
  * resolve classc4/8 port numbering errors in tsconnect config

# clonsl# and clonpc##:
  * yum remove kde*
  ** kde is too heavy and leaky for multiuser machines (e.g. vncservers)

# slm
  * ~stepanya/slmfit (use Ken's new scan/fitter)
  * scaler_calc2

# Annunciator
  * run cronjob for headless Annunciator (e.g. on clonpc17)

# procServMgr (in progress)
  * Update procServMgr for clasioc:clas 

# hardIOCS
  * import from hps-epics into clas12-epics

# firefox/chrome
  * Move default workspaces to puppet (e.g. /etc) and out of clas12-epics
  * Maybe workspace generator and wrapper scripts too

# autosave
  * make sure all (within reason) alarm fields are autosaved
  ** e.g. iocftaglv

# overview screens (mckinnon)
  * beamline
  * global

# jscalersApp (baltzell)
  * archive in mya
  ** careful about deadbands, lots of channels

# ftIntlkApp (baltzell)
  * finish FTH interlocks
  * probably should be in ioccaenhv_HVFTAG instead of a separate ioc

# ftcFlasherApp (kliv)
  * use native cs-studio confirm dialog instead of zenity popups (which get lost)?
  * use burt save/restore instead of users editing caget/caput scripts?

# genFlasherApp (kliv)
  * rename jflasherApp/jlabFlasherApp (a'la jscalerApp)
  * separate screens for individual channels (detectors)

# css_share/detectors/FTC:
  * change hv scripts to use DET hierarchy instead of HW

# iocmonitor (baltzell)
  * move cRio heartbeat calcs here rather than iocs on 86 (for power outages)

# pcMonitorApp (maybe one day)
  * to monitor/alarm resource usage on clonpcs

# diagguiserver in procserv (baltzell/boiarino)
  * not just a slow controls decision
  * currently rebooting crate is the method


#
# Long-term
#
# EPICS 3.15
# CS-Studio 4.5.0 (testing)
# ChannelFinder
# JLab Logbook integration in CS-Studio
