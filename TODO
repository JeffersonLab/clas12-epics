# TODO List
#

# caenHvApp/Db/caenhv.db
  * add stringin description record, human-readable, just for labelling purposes in multi-row screens

# Annunciator
  * run cronjob for headless Annunciator (e.g. on clonpc17)

# CS-Studio heap
  * up to 2 GB - done for new 4.3.3 version

# procServMgr
  * Update procServMgr with new paths to cfgs, etc (wmoore)  
  * Fix issue with procServMgr cron job not having correct environment
  ** affects iocs using snmp (iocvmeCrates, iocftaglv) due to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ** and scripts for iocftcFlasher due to PATH

# firefox/chrome
  * Move default workspaces to puppet (e.g. /etc) and out of clas12-epics
  * Maybe workspace generator and wrapper scripts too

# autosave
  * make sure all (within reason) alarm fields are autosaved
  ** e.g. iocftaglv

# overview screens (mckinnon)
  * beamline
  * global

# jscalersApp (baltzell)
  * archive in mya
  ** careful about deadbands, lots of channels

# ftIntlkApp (baltzell)
  * finish FTH interlocks
  * probably should be in ioccaenhv_HVFTAG instead of a separate ioc

# ftcFlasherApp (kliv)
  * use native cs-studio confirm dialog instead of zenity popups (which get lost)?
  * use burt save/restore instead of users editing caget/caput scripts?

# genFlasherApp (kliv)
  * rename jflasherApp/jlabFlasherApp (a'la jscalerApp)
  * separate screens for individual channels (detectors)

# vmecratesApp (nab)
  * archive in mya (esp. temps)

# css_share/detectors/FTC:
  * change hv scripts to use DET hierarchy instead of HW

# iocmonitor (baltzell)
  * move cRio heartbeat calcs here rather than iocs on 86 (for power outages)

# btaApp (kliv)
  * no business being on vxworks, move it to a softioc
  ** maybe shove it in iocmonitor

# pcMonitorApp (maybe one day)
  * to monitor/alarm resource usage on clonpcs

# diagguiserver in procserv (baltzell/boiarino)
  * not just a slow controls decision
  * currently rebooting crate is the method


#
# Long-term
#

# EPICS 3.15
# CS-Studio 4.3.3 (testing)
# ChannelFinder
# JLab Logbook integration in CS-Studio
