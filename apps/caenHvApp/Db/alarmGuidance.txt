Log all HV alarm activity in the HBLOG logbook.

HIHI = This means hardware is reporting an error.  Check the HV GUI for channel status, and, if tripped, try resetting the channel with the ON/OFF button from the GUI, otherwise contact the detector expert.  If any HIHI problem persists repeatedly efter aknowledging the alarm and resetting HV a couple times, contact the detector expert and leave the channel OFF.

LOLO = This means the IOC lost communications with the mainframe.  Try rebooting the associated IOC, and if LOLO alarm still remains 5 minutes after rebooting IOC, call the slow controls expert for diagnostics.

LO/HI = This is due to a mismatch between measured and demand voltage.  This can be caused by two things. #1:  Someone turned this channel on/off.  If you did it, shift personell in the counting house should already know what is going on and the alarm should be acknowledged, otherwise it is cause for concern.  #2:  This channel has a hardware voltage regulation issue noticed by software but not by hardware, in which case you should acknowledge the alarm and notify the detector expert for guidance.
