The 2005 Bonus run will have beam currents as high as 200nA.  The present
F-Cup calibration circuit only calibrates from 0 to 25nA.   This is done
via a -10 to 0 V 16bit DAC and a well measured 399.86 MegOhm resistor.

In order to calibrate beyond 25nA, a new resistor box was fabbed with a
not well measured 37 MeG Ohm resistor.   The value of the resistor
must be measured via cross calibration with the old 399.86 MegOhm resistor.

ItoV gain bits for nominal [<25nA] running:  010
ItoV gain bits for Bonus  [>100nA] running:  001

Load Bonus = 41.410 MegOhms
