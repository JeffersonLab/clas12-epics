#This file contains information on EPICS PVs to be pulled filled when json formatted messages are sent to an ActiveMQ message broker.
#The TOPIC is the title of this file (without the .dat suffix)
#makefile in the ioc directory will use this file to generate an ioc startup file called st.TOPIC.

#The remaining lines specify the PVs, with column headings as follows:
#Name:    A string with no spaces, underscores etc.
#Type:    A single character D,I,S (=Double, Integer, String)
#Nelem:   Number of elements for the PV. If >1, a waveform array type will be used.
#Tminor:  Timeout(s) for minor alarm (=0 to set to NO_ALARM)
#Tmajor:  Timeout(s) for minor alarm (=0 to set to NO_ALARM)
#Comment: Anything you like - it won't go into the EPICS db. Just for use here.
