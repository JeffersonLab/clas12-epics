 We have occaisonal read errors (log below) which result in no further
 PV updates (.STATs stay stuck in READ forever).  Dividing records into
 different scan rates appears to alleviate this a bit, as does reducing
 number of records, but even with only one record problem still happens.

 *** devSnmp 129.57.160.153 transaction (GET) error = 2 ((noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.)
 *** devSnmp SPAGENT-MIB::sensorProbeTempDegree.0 (GET) error = 2 ((noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.)
 *** devSnmp SPAGENT-MIB::sensorProbeTempDegree.0 (GET) flagged bad, error = 2 ((noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.)
 2016/12/31 18:02:10  devSnmp SPAGENT-MIB::sensorProbeTempDegree.0 data stale (20000 msec overdue for poll)
 2016/12/31 18:02:14  devSnmp AI read error 'B_WEATHER_FC0_Temp' : oid has no valid reading

 devSnmpSetParam(parname,value)
   DataStaleTimeoutMSec
   MaxOidCompFailures
   MaxTopPollWeight
   DoNotPollWeight
   ThreadSleepMSec
   SessionTimeout
   SessionRetries

 This didn't seem to help:
devSnmpSetMaxOidsPerReq("${IP2}",1)

 and neither did these:
devSnmpSetParam(ThreadSleepMSec,100)
devSnmpSetParam(SessionTimeout,100000)
devSnmpSetParam(SessionRetries,50)



 Did a shell script loop of snmpgets, and eventually hit this error
 below.  The following (10 seconds later) snmpget succeeded.  Since
 snmpgets recover, but devsnmp does not, either debug devsnmp module
 or write a one-off snmpget driver to fix this?

 Error in packet
 Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
 Failed object: SPAGENT-MIB::sensorProbeTempDegree.0



Moving the akcp mib file to the first dir in the search path seems to
greatly reduce error rate.  But it still errors.


********************************
Current Solution:
Commented out setting of flagged_read_bad in snmp-nscl-1-0-RC9/snmpApp/src/devSnmp.cpp
in devSnmp_oid::readReplyProcessing to allow it to continue to transmit snmp requests
even after it (faultily) determines the variable is missing from the MIB file.  This
succeeds on successive polls.
