apps/jscalerApp/Db/sums

These calc records are no longer used and were replaced by those in ../wf.
The records in ../wf use (pre-existing) sequencer waveform records as
inputs, and subArray+compress records to result in the same sums/avgs,
with about 30% less cpu usage than these summing calc records.
