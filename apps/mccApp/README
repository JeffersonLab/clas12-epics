DECEMBER 2016 (NAB):
- Pulled 3 records files (bpm/cryo/vacuum) into this mccApp from
  /home/epics/R3.13.4/epicsB/release-7-14/app/mcc_recs/db
- Built mccApp with proper dependencies and no litter
- Commented out the loading of those records for classc3 in
  /home/epics/R3.13.4/epicsB/release-7-14/ioc/classc3/startup.all
  and restarted classc3, which is now unneeded for CLAS12, and
  confirmed no duplicate channels
- Added info fields to records to autosave alarm fields
- Added ../iocBoot/iocmcc with proper startup with autosave, and
  corresponding autosave dirs in /usr/clas12/DATA/autosave/iocmcc
- Added iocmcc to CLAS12 ioc heartbeat and health screens
- Confirmed autosave on alarm limits is working by updating them
  and then restarting iocmcc
- Added iocmcc to procserv and started it with `procServMgr check`

  TODO:
- Update pv naming scheme to match CLAS12 heirarchy, including
  associated screens and alarms.
