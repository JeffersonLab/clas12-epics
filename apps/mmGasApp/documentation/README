Memory Mapping Notes
====================

- The latest memory map will be kept in EPICS_datas.xlsx.  This is provided 
from Saclay staff.  EPICS names provided by JLAB staff.  

- The memory map is generated on the PLC.  So it can change as modifications 
are made to the PLC code.

- The PLC uses byte offsets, while the EPICS Modbus driver uses word offsets. 
So the EPICS offsets are half what the PLC reports.  EPICS is also using 
Big-Endian for the most part.  Substitution files will specify the exact 
DATA_TYPE used for each value.
