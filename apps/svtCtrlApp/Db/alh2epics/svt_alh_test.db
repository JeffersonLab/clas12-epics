#To test with softIOC run
#softIOC st.cmd_svt_alhtest in this directory.
#The channels of interest will be:
#svt           :       The channel who's alarm state is monitored
#svtAlmCmd     :       The calc record which decides if and when to send the OFF command 
#svt:MODPB_OFF :       The channel to receive the OFF command

#>camonitor svt:MODPB_OFF
#caput svt 8     should result in a switch off (1 -> svt:MODPB_OFF) 
#should latch until MODPB_OFF has been returned to zero.

#These are for running in test mod
#The PC to monitor to decide whether to switch something off
