#This is to implement the switching off channels based on the alarm status. It was previously implemented in ALH.

#it writes a 1 to VAL
#if VAL has changes, then after a delay of ODLY seconds it writes 1 ot OUT (to trigger procesing of another calc to
#see it it's still MAJOR, and should initiate a switchoff.
