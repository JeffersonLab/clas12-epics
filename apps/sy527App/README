December 2016 (NAB):

Changes:
-  Was a 120 ms sleep for every channel write.  Reduced it to 48 ms.
-  Moved locking in read queue to lower level.  Now more lock/unlocks
   per read.  Locking in write queue unchanged.
-  Use group=0 (entire mainframe) read.  No fundamental speed
   improvement, but allows much better error checking on reads.  More
   robust since fewer transmits by factor of 2*NCHANNELS/5.
-  Corrected status bits for bigsub (alarm) value.
-  Added setcheck/fix records to check for missed writes (set vs setrbk)
   and correct them by issuing sets again.
-  Tested group=0 (entire mainframe) write of pwonoff.  Does give
   significant speed improvement over looping over channels for writes.
   Adds large complications in EPICS with updating single channel outputs
   so that outputs match inputs.  In the future may want to pursue this,
   but now performance is sufficient.  Note, when implementing group
   writes, updating single channel outputs will have to be addressed and/or
   setcheck/fix records discarded.
-  Mechanism to not issue single channels writes if readback already
   matches may be considered.
-  Moving setcheck/fix into driver instead of separate records may be good.
   However, records provide easy feedback if corrections are occurring.

Result:
-  With 1.5 mainframes (15 boards) on single CAENET card
-  1 second update time in EPICS between output and corresponding input
   update.  Previously *averaged* 20 seconds.
-  No bad readbacks.  Previously readback synchronization occaisonally
   erred (e.g. voltages read as currents).
-  Sets entire mainframe voltages in 30 seconds, maximum 1 minute, even
   after setcheck/fix records finish.  Previously this was few minutes.
-  Reducing sleep in write queue may have increased rate of missed writes.
   But deemed worthwhile since it allows much better EPICS feedback time
   and setcheck/fix records address missed writes.
