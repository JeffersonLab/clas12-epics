Currently just for debugging.  Not planning to display every
jlab scaler in cs-studio

Cole already has nice expert displays in coatjava for similar
things off ET-ring that can just be reused for EPICS scalers,
now that he is using Java CA client.


But sums could be useful for shift workers
 - by sector
 - by layer
 - etc
Or particular channels


DC has DCRB scalers not in EPICS yet
 -- 10K plus channels -- some sums might be good
